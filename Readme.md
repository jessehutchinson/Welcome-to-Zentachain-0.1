## Welcome to ZentaChain

ZentaChain technology allows distributed retention of encrypted data and is at the heart of cooperative Zenta Cloud storage.
Zentachain is a high-throughput blockchain platform designed to scale to thousands of transactions per second.(TPS)
It is a blockchain platform that can support dapps and process thousands of transactions per second.
This high transaction throughput relies on a scalability solution called sharding.
First is will its Efficient Sharding technology, a scalability solution that securely dynamically partitions
the blockchain. As a result of, zentachain will it to achieve greater than 100,000 transactions per second.

#### How does the Decentralized Memory work with ZentaChain ?

Distributed memory combines the best features of blockchain technology with attributes that meet the practical requirements of storing large amounts of data. As the name indicates, remote storage works by distributing the data across a network of ZentaChain nodes, similar to the distributed ledger of blockchain technology.

#### Why you should not trust a Cloud.

Currently, individual systems and even cloud-based databases are highly centralized.  This makes it a lighthouse for hackers who want to attack. You also have obvious sources of system errors if a controlling company should be affected, for example, as a result of a power failure.
In contrast, distributed storage does address these issues by using geographically distributed ZentaChain nodes either regionally or globally.


#### The problem with Blockchain.

While distributed memory shows some of the key features of the blockchain, we also need to think about how to store data "on the blockchain".
As blockchain was flooded with transactions, they too had to look for solutions to the problem of scalability.
The concept of storing large amounts of data on the blockchain is simply not plausible.

### The Solution of ZentaChain Sarding & IFPS:

What is sharding how will it work on ZentaChain?

Sharding by splitting up every block into a number of shards,each node in a network can process its own shard which later on will be  compiled back into the final zentachain-block.
In that way every zentachain-block takes around 2 minutes to be completely  processed. 

Compared to Bitcoin, which consists of one block that takes 10 minutes to be verified and processed. zentachain is designed in such a way that the block needs about two minutes per confirmation. zentachain is much faster! Another issue  with Bitcoin is that virtually all miners work on one block at the same time, zentachain believes that the work is, so to speak, subordinate and much more divided. When you divide its core into much smaller departments (blocks), you then have the possibility to process many more transactions simultaneously.

For example: take 100 people, who each work in groups of ten. Each group of the ten works on their own project (ie. transactions) or their own task within the blockchain. In the end all results are compiled and placed on the main block (zentachain), in this case is number 1, as You can see here in this diagram ZentaChain  in green.(https://zentachain.io) The sharded  ZentaChain block takes 2 minutes per block vs the whole bitcoin block which takes 10 minutes to complete each confirmation 

ZentaChain has several advantages over other blockchains:
The confirmation does not take as long as other blockchains ie. Bitcoin
if a transaction utilizes the micro blocks, you'll get a confirmation in seconds. The micro blocks are more efficient because the work is divided. The More blocks you have the faster and greater the transaction process becomes.  
This leads to a significantly greater scalability

##### What is IFPS?

IPFS stands for InterPlanetary File Sharing and is a type of protocol used for distributed file sharing, comparable to that of the Wold Wide Web. IPFS is known as the permanent web. According to GitHub, IPFS is defined as:  A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS is similar to Tor’s open source where anyone can contribute to the projects development code. 

What is the problem with the World Wide Web?
     
For example, companies such  as Wikipedia or Dropbox, rely on centralized servers where users worldwide must retrieve their content from these lone servers. 

The problem with this, is that a centralized server has the potential to become overloaded and crash due to its inability to support such a high volume of data requests. Other problems that may arise, for example, Wikipedia stops providing the sought after content, decides to change it, or if a government blocks access to the main servers altogether. These are just a few problems with the centralized web of today. 

How is IPFS different from the World Wide Web?

When using IPFS, all content data uploaded via the protocol becomes highly standardized and immutable, meaning it can’t be changed, altered or otherwise corrupted.  

IPFS doesn’t rely on centralized servers at all and is able to transform regular computing devices into distributed network servers. This gives individual devices the ability to send, store, and receive any data, becoming a completely autonomous server.  

IPFS gives the distributed server networks the ability to cross communicate, allowing the user to retrieve the sought after data from the closest server, making it far more efficient then the World Wide Web.

##### Why ZentaChain will integrate IPFS protocol?
   
ZentaChain will utilize IPFS distributed protocol to securely send, store, and retrieve its data.  
IPFS enables the creation of distributed apps and services. 

The most important aspect of IPFS is it’s ability to be censorship resistant due to the same data being distributed by different servers all over the world. 
This makes it impossible to block or censor all seed servers.
A sever that isn’t blocked would simply pick up the request and send the data. 

ZentaChain’s services will become completely secure, tamperproof and censorship resistant with the integration of IPFS distributed protocol.

##### ZentaCloud-OV.
ZentaCloud’ is decentralized anonymous messenger with p2p  blockchain & IPFS .
ZentaChain is a secure, decentralized messenger with an integrated payment system.
ZentaChain can not be disabled or blocked because it does not have centralized servers
and all information is encrypted in a distributed data store (IPFS).

##### ZentaCloud-OV2
ZentaChain is offering a new highly encrypted and secure blockchain cloud for your personal data storage. Unlike normal cloud services, we do not have a centralized server. Nobody can attack and access our server directly. Unlike regular cloud services even the ZentaChain team does not have access to your personal data.
Mesh Network, also known as MeshNet, is an alternative to the Internet that has zero centralized authority . No ISP is required for MeshNet as every device on the network becomes its own wireless provider.

## Zentap2p

##### Zentap2p&MeshNet
The meshnet allows for computer devices to connect and interact wirelessly, creating its own web while not using a standard cable modem. This allows for easy set up with minimal infrastructure.

Computers act as nodes and connect to one another. Users can anonymously send and receive encrypted data through the MeshNet. Only the user receiving the encrypted data can retrieve it with an encryption key.

Censorship resistance is a unique feature of the MeshNet being that one network is blocked or removed the neighboring networks will take notice and reroute data accordingly, recognizing and solving this problem.

In the private sphere, more and more routers, WLAN repeaters and powerline adapters dominate mesh functions. Thanks to this technology it is possible to make a complete wireless coverage of your own home or house. For example, in the most recent operating systems, the FritzBox router, powerline adapters and repeaters, which are very popular in Germany, implement extensive mesh functions. The user interface of the FritzBoxes has been displayed in which the individual components of the mesh network and their connections. But other manufacturers like Netgear or Linksys and others support the development of a private wireless mesh network.

The goal of ZentaChain is to maintain the knots in the MeshNet and connect to each other through the Zentap2p. Our goal is to use it all over the world to regain your natural right of communication. Zentap2p enables communication worldwide without a central server storing your data. Live chat between people all over the world.

Private messages can only be seen by senders and recipients (wallet-to-wallet)

You can also stay connected in an emergency at Zentap2p without having internet access. (Offline to Offline) If there are more than two devices, they will form a network and messages will be transferred to the next, extending the range of the Zentap2p token holder.

##### MeshNetwork

A Mesh Network, also known as MeshNet, is an alternative to the internet without any centralized authority. Every participant in the MeshNet represents an independent Node that functions as a fully active access point to the network making it the most reliable form of a network available. Whenever a node leaves the network the remaining nodes can easily redistribute the dataflow to the best available connection.

The MeshNet functions wirelessly and allows computers and devices to interact without a cable modem. The devices themselves create a largely distributed network which can potentially cover the whole globe. Users in the MeshNet can anonymously send and receive encrypted data securely by swapping encryption keys, making the data inaccessible to any third party.

In the future this network of distributed node-miniservers could stay available even if the regular internet collapsed. All data potentially stored on a blockchain would remain online as long as there are active nodes in the network.

Unlike the regular internet the MeshNet is also immune to censorship. Not only because it is a completely decentralized network, also due to its uniquely intelligent distribution and healing properties. A node that is taken offline will automatically be compensated by redistributing the traffic in the best way possible to the existing nodes around it. That way information will continue to travel through the network at the best rate possible without interruption.

In the last couple of years mesh networking functions have been integrated more and more into everyday applications. Especially in consumer electronics routers, WLAN repeaters and powerline adapters started implementing the technology. For instance, the well-known German internet solution FritzBox is using MeshNet components with information that can be shown on a graphic display.

The vision of Zentap2p is to utilize this very technology to bring worldwide, secure 24/7 live communication and data exchange to the masses. Without a central authority communication can run in between the active network nodes, increasing the networks coverage with every joining user. As long as there are at least two active users in the MeshNet, communication can occur without the need for an internet or telephone service provider.

##### What is our vision
Zentachain vision is 
people who don’t trust one another—share valuable data in a secure, tamperproof way. That’s because zentachains store data using sophisticated math and innovative software rules that are extremely difficult for attackers to manipulate.
